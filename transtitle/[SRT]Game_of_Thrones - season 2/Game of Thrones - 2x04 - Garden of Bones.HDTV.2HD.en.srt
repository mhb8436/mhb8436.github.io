1
00:00:01,196 --> 00:00:02,395
Does it ever end?

2
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,861
This is further east
<i>than I've ever been.</i>

3
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:13,367
May I present my wife
Margaery of House Tyrell?

4
00:00:13,402 --> 00:00:15,303
You are very welcome
here, Lady Stark.

5
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:18,072
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us,
he should come himself.

6
00:00:18,106 --> 00:00:20,741
My son is fighting a war,

7
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:22,509
<i>not playing at one.</i>

8
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:25,078
I cannot defeat
my brother in the field.

9
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:27,714
You must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

10
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:30,049
I've said the words,
damn you.

11
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,819
I will give you a son.

12
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:35,067
We've come to
a dangerous place.

13
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,604
NY sister wants to hurt me.
She can't know about you.

14
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,689
Who are you?

15
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:41,741
I'm Shae, My Lady.
Your new handmaiden.

16
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,811
I didn't know I needed
a new handmaiden.

17
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:46,915
<i>You fought bravely today,</i>
<i>Lady Brienne.</i>

18
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:49,818
I fought for my king. Soon I'll
fight for him on the battlefield.

19
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:51,686
Die for him
if I must.

20
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:00,962
You told the Queen
about my plans

21
00:01:00,996 --> 00:01:03,031
- to send Myrcella to Dorne.
- Never!

22
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:04,899
Throw him in one
of the black cells.

23
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:06,601
Myrcella is
my only daughter.

24
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:09,069
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

25
00:01:09,104 --> 00:01:11,005
- It's done, Cersei.
- No.

26
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,875
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

27
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,056
Not tonight.

28
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:17,111
There's another Tyrell
who requires your attention.

29
00:01:18,682 --> 00:01:19,578
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:19,603 --> 00:01:21,178
Do you want my brother
to come in and help?

31
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:22,769
I don't know what
you're talking about.

32
00:01:22,794 --> 00:01:23,453
There's no need

33
00:01:23,454 --> 00:01:26,123
for us to play games.
Save your lies for court.

34
00:01:26,158 --> 00:01:27,558
You're going to need
a lot of them.

35
00:01:27,592 --> 00:01:29,961
My brother Jaime rots
in a northern stockade.

36
00:01:29,995 --> 00:01:32,565
Robb Stark will never
release the Kingslayer.

37
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,776
But his mother might.

38
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:35,990
How would you like to see
your beloved Cat again?

39
00:01:36,337 --> 00:01:39,173
<i>- Outside!</i>
- Come here, boy!

40
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:42,510
Sweet boy, help us.
Give it to me.

41
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:50,652
<i>Round up any survivors.</i>

42
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:52,855
We'll take them back
to Harrenhal.

43
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:54,824
We're looking for
a bastard named Gendry.

44
00:01:54,858 --> 00:01:57,394
You want Gendry?
You already got him.

It's got to be the Mountain.
He's the biggest.

49
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:02,689
- He's the strongest.
- Bulls are bigger than lions.

Loras Tyrell?

Loras Tyrell.
He's prettier than the queen.

I don't care about pretty.

He's better with a sword

How good could he be?

59
00:04:24,246 --> 00:04:26,681
He's been stabbing
Renly Baratheon for years,

60
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:29,284
and Renly ain't dead.

61
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,062
The horses seem
a little spooked to you?

62
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:41,997
They're horses.

63
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,133
They get spooked
by their own shadows.

64

Shh.

65
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:50,372

No.

There's something
out there.

68
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:20,503
Oh.

69
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:22,939
Oh, you're a right
little prick.

70
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:24,641
You should see
your face.

71
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:27,077
I swear you
pissed yourself.

72

"Oh, who goes there?
Ahh!"

73
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,080
There is something out there.

00:05:31,115 --> 00:05:33,483
Yeah, don't even try me.

75

Rennick!

They're dead.
Take everything they've got.

<i>We've nowhere to keep</i>
<i>all these prisoners.</i>

Barely enough food

We're not executing
prisoners, Lord Bolton.

Of course, Your Grace.

84
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:24,432
The officers
will be useful.

85
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:27,601
Some of them may be privy
to Tywin Lannister's plans.

86
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:29,370
I doubt it.

87
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:31,305
<i>Well, we'll learn</i>
<i>soon enough.</i>

88
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,243
In my family we say,
"A naked man has few secrets.

89
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:37,179
A flayed man none."

90
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:39,181
My father outlawed
flaying in the North.

91
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:42,418
- We're not in the North.
- We're not torturing them.

92
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:44,387
The high road's very pretty,

93
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:47,189
but you'll have a hard time
marching your army down it.

94
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:49,992
The Lannisters hold
prisoners of their own.

95
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:53,195
I won't give them an excuse
to abuse my sisters.

96
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,331
<i>No, no, don't! Don't!</i>

97
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,066
<i>- Shh, shh.</i>
<i>- </i> <i>Please!</i>

98
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,701
Shh.

99
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,337
The rot's set in.

100
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:05,840
No, don't!
No, don't!

101
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:08,576
- Shh.
- Please, don't!

102
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,644
It'll get better.
It doesn't even hurt.

103
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:13,815
The rot will spread.
If we don't take the foot now--

104
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:15,983
No, you can't!

105
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:20,721
Ser! Please, Ser.

106
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:22,557
- I can't lose--
- You'll die if she does it.

107
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:24,426
I don't want to be
a cripple, please.

108
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,695
Surely one of our men needs your
attention more than this cub.

109
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,564
Your men are not
my men, My Lord.

110
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:32,500
Put this in your mouth and lie down.
You don't want to watch.

111
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:35,403
- No! You can't!
- Bite on it.

112
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:37,472
It's better than biting
your own tongue, believe me.

113
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:14,543
- What's your name?
Talisa.

114
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,579
<i>Your last name?</i>

115
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,848
You want to know what side
my family fights on?

116
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:21,316
You know my family name.
You have me at a disadvantage.

117
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:24,152
That boy lost his foot
on your orders.

118
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:26,288
They killed my father.

119
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:29,157
- That boy did?
- The family he fights for.

120
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:32,193
Do you think he's friends
with King Joffrey?

121
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:34,762
<i>He's a Fisherman's son</i>
<i>that grew up near Lannisport.</i>

122
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:36,012
He probably never held a spear

123
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:37,927
before they shoved one in his
hands a few months ago.

124
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:40,168
I have no hatred
for the lad.

125
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:43,771
That should help
his foot grow back.

126
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:50,411
You'd have us surrender,
end all this bloodshed.

127
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,748
I understand.
The country would be at peace

128
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,721
and life would be just
under the righteous hand

129
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:57,046
of good King Joffrey.

130
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:59,788
- You're going to kill Joffrey?
- If the Gods give me strength.

131
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:03,259
- And then what?
- I don't know.

132
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,228
We'll go back
to Winterfell.

133
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:07,263
I have no desire to sit
on the Iron Throne.

134
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,899
So who will?

135
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:11,967
I don't know.

136
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:13,937
You're fighting
to overthrow a king,

137
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,739
and yet you have no plan
for what comes after?

138
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:18,374
First we have
to win the war.

139
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:25,581
You never told me
where you're from.

140
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:27,983
- Volantis.
- Volantis?

141
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:30,753
You're far from home.

142
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:33,055
The boy was lucky
you were here.

143
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:36,157
He was unlucky
that you were.

144
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:47,067
You're here to answer for your
brother's latest treasons.

145
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:48,802
Your Grace,

146
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:52,138
whatever my traitor brother
has done, I had no part.

147
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:53,640
You know that.
I beg you--

148
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:55,709
Ser Lancel, tell her
of this outrage.

149
00:09:55,743 --> 00:09:58,011
<i>Using some vile sorcery,</i>

150
00:09:58,045 --> 00:10:00,580
your brother fell on Stafford Lannister
with an army of wolves.

151
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:03,616
Thousands of good men
were butchered.

152
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:06,155
After the slaughter,
the northmen feasted on

153
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,862
the flesh of the slain.

154
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:12,460
Killing you would send
your brother a message.

155
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:18,500
But my mother insists
on keeping you alive.

156
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,302
Stand.

157
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:23,697
So we'll have to send
your brother

158
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:25,722
a message some other way.

159
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,078
Meryn.

160
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:34,716
Leave her face.

161
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:36,284
I like her pretty.

162
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:45,674
Meryn, My Lady
is overdressed.

163
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:48,296
Unburden her.

164
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:55,804
If you want Robb Stark
to hear us,

165
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,974
we're going to have
to speak louder.

166
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:02,012
<i>What is the meaning</i>
<i>of this?</i>

167
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:12,889
What kind of Knight
beats a helpless girl?

168
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,091
The kind who serves
his King, Imp.

169
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:16,559
Careful, now. We don't want

170
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:18,394
to get blood all over your
pretty white cloak.

171
00:11:18,395 --> 00:11:21,497
Someone get the girl something
to cover herself with.

172
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:23,732
She is to be your queen.

173
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,600
Have you no regard
for her honor?

174
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:27,802
<i>- I'm punishing her.</i>
<i>- For what crimes?</i>

175
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:30,105
<i>She did not fight her</i>
<i>brother's battle, you half-wit.</i>

176
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,708
You can't talk to me like that.
The king can do as he likes!

177
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:35,610
The Mad King
did as he liked.

178
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:39,081
Has your Uncle Jaime ever told
you what happened to him?

179
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:42,051
No one threatens his Grace
in the presence of the Kingsguard.

180
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:44,121
I'm not threatening
the King, Ser.

181
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:45,722
I am educating my nephew.

182
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:49,093
Bronn, the next time
Ser Meryn speaks, kill him.

183
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:53,464
That was a threat.
See the difference?

184
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:18,757
<i>I apologize for</i>
<i>my nephew's behavior.</i>

185
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:21,723
Tell me the truth.

186
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:23,748
Do you want an end
to this engagement?

187
00:12:23,764 --> 00:12:27,768
I am loyal to King Joffrey,
my one true love.

188
00:12:30,905 --> 00:12:36,109
Lady Stark, you may
survive us yet.

189
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:41,547
The little king's
backed up.

190
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:44,950
Clogged from balls
to brains.

191
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:47,686
You think dipping his wick
will cure what ails him?

192
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:50,689
There's no cure
for being a cunt.

193
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:52,991
But the boy's at that age.

194
00:12:53,026 --> 00:12:56,728
And he's got nothing to do all
day but pick wings off flies.

195
00:12:56,763 --> 00:12:59,298
Couldn't hurt to get
some of the poison out.

196
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:09,041
What are you
doing here, dog?

197
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:11,410
Your uncle left
your nameday present

198
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:13,912
and asked me to see
that you got it.

199
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:18,484
And?

200
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:20,619
What is it?

201
00:13:20,653 --> 00:13:23,089
Look inside,
Your Grace.

202
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:31,931
Your Grace.

203
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:34,835
- Happy nameday, Your Grace.
- My nameday has passed.

204
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:37,671
We won't tell
if you won't.

205
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:42,944
No.

206
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:44,746
Her.

207
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,151
Touch her.

208
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:12,506
Could you hit her?

209
00:14:25,755 --> 00:14:27,423
My uncle sent you?

210
00:14:27,457 --> 00:14:29,592
Yes, Your Grace.

211
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:30,961
He chose us himself.

212
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,762
Hmm.

213
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:43,841
Use this.

214
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:58,055
Harder.

215
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:06,563
I said harder.

216
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:11,101
He'd want me to get
his money's worth.

217
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:57,514
Your Grace, too much pain
will spoil the pleasure.

218
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:02,318
<i>Please, please</i>

219
00:16:06,856 --> 00:16:08,190
please, Your Grace.

220
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:12,260
Your Grace,
if your uncle finds out--

221
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:14,129
Oh, I want him
to find out.

222
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:17,432
You will bring her to his
chambers when you're finished

223
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:19,667
and show him
what you've done.

224
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,871
Or the same thing
will happen to you.

225
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:32,146
Begin.

226
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,891
Harder!

227
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:56,638
Well, if it isn't
my favorite whoremonger.

228
00:16:56,673 --> 00:16:59,574
Pray I haven't kept
you waiting long.

229
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:03,811
Your Grace.

230
00:17:07,149 --> 00:17:10,451
Now you do the Lannisters'
bidding, is that it?

231
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:13,687
Tell me, was my brother's
body even cold

232
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:15,889
before you secured
your newest patron?

233
00:17:15,924 --> 00:17:18,292
I'm a practical man.

234
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:21,595
Just not a loyal one.

235
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:23,564
<i>And who would you have</i>
<i>me be loyal to?</i>

236
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:25,532
Your brother's corpse?

237
00:17:27,668 --> 00:17:30,736
I don't like you,
Lord Baelish.

238
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:33,105
I don't like your face.

239
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,542
I don't like the words that come
oozing out of your mouth.

240
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:40,146
I don't want you in my tent
one minute more than necessary.

241
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:43,382
So tell me,
why are you here?

242
00:17:44,384 --> 00:17:46,386
<i>You can trust Brienne.</i>

243
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,921
Her loyalty comes
without charge.

244
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:54,126
You still have many friends
at court, Your Grace,

245
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:57,564
many who believe
Ned Stark erred

246
00:17:57,598 --> 00:17:59,733
by not supporting
your claim.

247
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:03,904
Now I understand.

248
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:05,840
You know I have
the numbers.

249
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:08,643
You know I'm marching
on King's Landing.

250
00:18:08,677 --> 00:18:11,845
When I take the throne,
you hope to retain your position.

251
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:15,282
And your head.

252
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:18,284
I would give priority
to my head.

253
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:20,786
<i>I understand that</i>
<i>you don't like me,</i>

254
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:23,155
and while that
saddens me greatly,

255
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,824
I did not come here today
seeking your affection.

256
00:18:27,226 --> 00:18:29,360
<i>When you march</i>
<i>on King's Landing,</i>

257
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:32,797
you may find yourself facing
a protracted siege or...

258
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:36,034
open gates.

259
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,453
Your Grace.

260
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:58,423
Lord Baelish.

261
00:18:58,457 --> 00:19:01,593
All of these tents
look the same to me.

262
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:03,962
- Would you be so kind--
- it would be my pleasure.

263
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:06,831
It took me weeks to learn
way around the camp.

264
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:09,901
Twice I walked in on officers
in stages of undress.

265
00:19:09,936 --> 00:19:12,604
And the moment I learn
which tent is mine,

266
00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:14,340
we're on the move again.

267
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:16,007
Your tent?

268
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:18,177
Not our tent?

269
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:20,579
The King snores, perhaps?

270
00:19:20,614 --> 00:19:23,716
Or simply prefers
solitude?

271
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,620
Pressures of command,
no doubt.

272
00:19:26,654 --> 00:19:29,356
Four kings vying
for the throne.

273
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,758
I am not tutored
in warfare,

274
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:35,462
but basic arithmetic favors the
side with the greater numbers.

275
00:19:35,464 --> 00:19:37,101
If war were arithmetic,

276
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:39,280
the mathematicians
would rule the world.

277
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:43,604
But I did notice your brother
entering his Grace's tent the just now.

278
00:19:43,638 --> 00:19:45,839
The place of a Kingsguard
is by the King's side.

279
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:47,908
And on the night
of the your wedding,

280
00:19:47,943 --> 00:19:50,678
who was by
the King's side then?

281
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:52,914
You seem quite interested
in our marriage.

282
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:55,517
Your marriage
is quite interesting...

283
00:19:55,551 --> 00:19:58,654
Not only to me,
but to the realm.

284
00:19:58,688 --> 00:20:01,791
The marriage of a wealthy girl
always breeds interest,

285
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,960
if nothing else.

286
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,895
You've never married,
have you?

287
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,300
I've been unlucky
in my affections, sadly.

288
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,736
That is sad.

289
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,537
Though perhaps
it's for the best.

290
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:16,839
The whole notion of marriage
seems to confuse you,

291
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:19,075
so allow me to explain.

292
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:23,546
My husband is my King,
and my King is my husband.

293
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,116
Here is your tent,
Lord Baelish. Good night.

294
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,509
What do you know
of this place?

295
00:21:24,543 --> 00:21:26,678
Only that the desert
around their walls

296
00:21:26,712 --> 00:21:28,847
is called
the Garden of Nes.

297
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,451
Every time the Qartheen
shut their gates on a traveler,

298
00:21:33,486 --> 00:21:35,720
the garden grows.

299
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,067
- Go on!
- You, keep moving!

300
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:00,711
<i>Bring her about!</i>

301
00:22:00,745 --> 00:22:03,714
What kind of fire
melts stone?

302
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:05,649
Dragon fire.

303
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:07,418
There's dragons here?

304
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:10,054
No, all the dragons
are dead.

305
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:12,290
What's that smell?

306
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,695
Dead people.

307
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,865
Move.

308
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:28,976
<i>Please, please, no, no!</i>

309
00:22:35,683 --> 00:22:38,719
<i>No.</i>

310
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:51,231
<i>He's dead.</i>

311
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:54,434
He was my son.

312
00:22:56,304 --> 00:22:59,706
My sister
was three days ago.

313
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:02,809
My husband,
the day before that.

314
00:23:03,778 --> 00:23:06,079
They take someone
every day?

315
00:23:08,383 --> 00:23:10,484
Does anyone live?

316
00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:36,410
Joffrey.

317
00:23:36,444 --> 00:23:38,411
Cersei.

318
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:40,213
Ilyn Payne.

319
00:23:40,247 --> 00:23:42,148
The Hound.

320
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:44,550
Joffrey.

321
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:47,252
Cersei.

322
00:23:47,286 --> 00:23:49,221
Ilyn Payne.

323
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:50,989
The Hound.

324
00:23:51,023 --> 00:23:54,225
Joffrey. Cersei.

325
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,295
Ilyn Payne.
The Hound.

326
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,867
How dare you?

327
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:04,769
You may have heard
false reports.

328
00:24:04,804 --> 00:24:07,306
- You betrayed Ned.
- <i>Betrayed?</i>

329
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,274
I wanted him to serve
as Protector of the Realm.

330
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:10,843
I begged him
to seize the moment.

331
00:24:10,877 --> 00:24:14,981
I trusted you.
My husband trusted you.

332
00:24:15,015 --> 00:24:18,284
And you repaid our faith
with treachery.

333
00:24:18,318 --> 00:24:19,619
- No, My Lady.
- Get out!

334
00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:21,822
Cat, I've--

335
00:24:21,856 --> 00:24:24,491
I've loved you
since I was a boy.

336
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:28,429
It seems to me that fate
has given us this chance--

337
00:24:28,464 --> 00:24:31,865
Have you lost your mind?
Get out!

338
00:24:45,144 --> 00:24:47,479
Do you want to see
your girls again?

339
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:53,318
Sansa, more beautiful
than ever.

340
00:24:53,353 --> 00:24:57,390
And Arya,
just as wild as ever.

341
00:24:57,424 --> 00:24:59,626
You have Arya, too?

342
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,730
Both girls are healthy
and safe...

343
00:25:03,765 --> 00:25:06,767
<i>for now.</i>

344
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:10,604
But you know the Queen
and you know Joffrey.

345
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,573
I fear for
their longevity

346
00:25:13,608 --> 00:25:15,809
if they remain
in the capital.

347
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:39,065
What do you want?

348
00:25:40,668 --> 00:25:43,738
The Lannisters will trade your
daughters for the Kingslayer.

349
00:25:43,772 --> 00:25:45,339
Of course they will.

350
00:25:45,374 --> 00:25:48,043
Jaime Lannister
for two girls?

351
00:25:48,077 --> 00:25:49,645
Robb will never agree
to those terms.

352
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,981
I'm not bringing
these terms to him.

353
00:25:52,015 --> 00:25:53,882
I'm bringing them
to you.

354
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:56,518
You think I'd keep
secrets from my son?

355
00:25:56,553 --> 00:25:59,455
Robb has surprised them all
with his skills in battle,

356
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:01,423
but he's not a mother.

357
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:04,292
<i>Consider it, Cat.</i>

358
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:07,062
<i>You may not get</i>
<i>another chance.</i>

359
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:14,002
- I've brought you a gift.
- I don't want your gifts.

360
00:26:14,036 --> 00:26:17,339
A token of Tyrion
Lannister's goodwill.

361
00:26:17,373 --> 00:26:21,510
He wants you to understand
that this exchange of prisoners

362
00:26:21,544 --> 00:26:23,646
is offered in good faith.

363
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,614
Good faith?

364
00:26:29,486 --> 00:26:31,420
What's this?

365
00:27:00,883 --> 00:27:04,052
Your husband was
an honorable man.

366
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:07,790
He should rest beside his family
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

367
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:14,597
- You may not believe--
- get out.

368
00:27:46,462 --> 00:27:50,132
<i>Get up, you dogs!</i>

369
00:28:00,643 --> 00:28:03,944
That's him,
the one who picks.

370
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:06,113
The Mountain.

371
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,750
What are you doing?

372
00:28:10,784 --> 00:28:12,919
He told me he stares
at him every day.

373
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:15,422
That's why he
doesn't get picked.

374
00:28:40,815 --> 00:28:42,683
You.

375
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:45,453
<i>Move, boy!</i>

376
00:28:45,488 --> 00:28:47,956
Move!

377
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,611
<i>Is there gold and silver</i>
<i>in the village?</i>

378
00:29:08,645 --> 00:29:11,147
- I don't know.
- <i>Gems?</i>

379
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:13,382
I didn't see any.

380
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:15,785
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

381
00:29:31,602 --> 00:29:34,470
<i>- Where is the Brotherhood?</i>
- I don't know. Please.

382
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:37,306
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

383
00:29:42,712 --> 00:29:44,680
Which of the villagers
aided them?

384
00:29:44,714 --> 00:29:47,282
- I don't know.
- Who?

385
00:29:47,316 --> 00:29:49,518
I--

386
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:54,890
- Who?
- I never saw.

387
00:29:54,924 --> 00:29:56,558
- Who?
- I never saw.

388
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:59,695
Please. Please, stop.
Please, it's starting to--

389
00:29:59,729 --> 00:30:03,032
- <i>Who?</i>
- I didn't see anyone help him.

390
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:05,468
Take it off! Take it off!

391
00:30:05,502 --> 00:30:07,869
- <i>Who helped him?</i>
- Ganes the butcher

392
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:09,738
- and his son.
- That's better.

393
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:13,008
- <i>You've been very helpful.</i>
- No, stop, please!

394
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:15,443
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Please, stop!</i>

395
00:30:15,477 --> 00:30:17,979
<i>Please, stop!</i>
<i>No! No!</i>

396
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:20,214
I told you everything!
No!

397
00:30:20,248 --> 00:30:23,551
No!

398
00:30:23,585 --> 00:30:26,820
Joffrey.

399
00:30:26,855 --> 00:30:28,956
Cersei.

400
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,459
Ilyn Payne.
The Hound.

401
00:30:31,493 --> 00:30:34,228
<i>Please, Polliver.</i>
<i>Some food.</i>

402
00:30:34,263 --> 00:30:36,998
Just a crust of bread.

403
00:30:41,304 --> 00:30:43,272
Polliver.

404
00:30:43,307 --> 00:30:45,575
The Mountain.

405
00:31:02,592 --> 00:31:05,661
Lady Stark, I had not thought
to find you in the Stormlands.

406
00:31:05,695 --> 00:31:09,264
I had not thought
to be here, Lord Stannis.

407
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:12,667
- Can that truly be you?
- Who else might it be?

408
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:15,437
When I saw your standard,
I couldn't be sure.

409
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:18,006
- Whose banner is that?
- My own.

410
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,609
I suppose if we used
the same one,

411
00:31:20,644 --> 00:31:23,412
the battle would be
terribly confusing.

412
00:31:23,447 --> 00:31:25,648
<i>Why is your stag</i>
<i>on fire?</i>

413
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,518
The King has taken
for his sigil

414
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:30,554
the fiery heart
of the Lord of Light.

415
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:35,025
Ah, you must be this fire
priestess we hear so much about.

416
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,261
<i>Mm, brother,</i>

417
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,564
now I understand why you
found religion in your old age.

418
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,033
Watch yourself, Renly.

419
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,103
<i>No, no, I'm relieved.</i>

420
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,305
I never really believed
you're a fanatic.

421
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,675
Charmless, rigid,
a bore, yes,

422
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,511
but not a godly man.

423
00:31:54,948 --> 00:31:57,249
You should kneel
he's the Lord's chosen,

424
00:31:57,284 --> 00:31:59,619
<i>born amidst salt</i>
<i>and smoke.</i>

425
00:31:59,653 --> 00:32:01,821
Born amidst salt
and smoke?

426
00:32:01,855 --> 00:32:03,123
Is he a ham?

427
00:32:03,157 --> 00:32:05,092
<i>That's twice</i>
<i>I've warned you.</i>

428
00:32:05,126 --> 00:32:07,027
Listen to yourselves.

429
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:10,297
If you were sons of mine, I
would knock your heads together

430
00:32:10,332 --> 00:32:11,999
and lock you in a bedchamber
until you remembered

431
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:13,634
that you were brothers.

432
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:16,336
It is strange to find you
beside my brother, Lady Stark.

433
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,172
<i>Your husband was a supporter</i>
<i>of my claim.</i>

434
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:21,241
Lord Eddard's integrity
cost him his head.

435
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:24,310
And you sit beside this pretender
and chastise me.

436
00:32:24,345 --> 00:32:26,012
We share a common enemy.

437
00:32:26,047 --> 00:32:29,749
The Iron Throne
is mine by right.

438
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:33,219
All those that deny that
are my foes.

439
00:32:33,254 --> 00:32:36,489
The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.

440
00:32:36,524 --> 00:32:38,258
Old men deny it
with their death rattle

441
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:41,161
and unborn children deny it
in their mother's wombs.

442
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:45,398
No one wants you
for their King.

443
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:48,634
<i>You never wanted</i>
<i>any friends, brother.</i>

444
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:51,103
<i>But a man without friends</i>
<i>is a man without power.</i>

445
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:54,673
For the sake of the mother
who bore us,

446
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:57,076
I will give you this one night
to reconsider.

447
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,712
Strike your banners,

448
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:02,347
come to me before dawn,

449
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:05,283
and I will grant you
your old seat in the council.

450
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:09,253
I'll even name you
my heir

451
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,122
until a son
is born to me.

452
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:15,460
Otherwise I shall
destroy you.

453
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:20,899
Look across
those fields, brother.

454
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:23,569
<i>Can you see</i>
<i>all those banners?</i>

455
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:26,339
You think a few bolts
of cloth will make you King?

456
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:28,541
No.

457
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,712
The men holding those bolts
of cloth will make me King.

458
00:33:31,746 --> 00:33:33,614
We shall see, Renly.

459
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:36,384
Come the dawn,
we shall see.

460
00:33:36,418 --> 00:33:38,586
Look to your sins,
Lord Renly.

461
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:41,122
The night is dark
and full of terrors.

462
00:33:46,662 --> 00:33:50,230
Would you believe
I loved him once?

463
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,620
I thought we were welcome.

464
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:15,523
If you heard a Dothraki horde
was approaching your city,

465
00:34:15,557 --> 00:34:17,591
you might do the same,
Khaleesi.

466
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:21,995
Horde?

467
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:38,745
My name is Daenerys--

468
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,015
Daenerys Stormborn
of the House Targaryen.

469
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,084
You know me, My Lord?

470
00:34:44,118 --> 00:34:46,754
Only by reputation,
Khaleesi.

471
00:34:46,788 --> 00:34:50,324
And I'm no lord,
merely a humble merchant.

472
00:34:51,427 --> 00:34:54,062
They call you
the Mother of Dragons.

473
00:34:54,096 --> 00:34:56,064
And what should
I call you?

474
00:34:56,098 --> 00:34:57,666
Oh, my name is quite long

475
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,269
and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.

476
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:03,907
I am simply a trader
of spices.

477
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:07,277
But we are the Thirteen,

478
00:35:07,312 --> 00:35:10,648
charged with the governance
and protection of Qarth,

479
00:35:10,682 --> 00:35:14,385
the greatest city
that ever was or will be.

480
00:35:15,687 --> 00:35:18,220
The beauty of
Quarth is legendary--

481
00:35:18,245 --> 00:35:20,245
Qarth.

482
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:23,327
Qarth.

483
00:35:23,362 --> 00:35:26,397
Might we see
the dragons?

484
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:34,405
My friend,

485
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,874
we have travelled
very far.

486
00:35:36,908 --> 00:35:39,409
<i>We have no food,</i>
<i>no water.</i>

487
00:35:39,444 --> 00:35:41,911
Once I see my people fed,
I would be honored--

488
00:35:41,946 --> 00:35:44,781
Forgive me,
Mother of Dragons,

489
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:48,818
but no man alive has seen
a living dragon.

490
00:35:48,852 --> 00:35:51,020
Some of my more
skeptical friends

491
00:35:51,054 --> 00:35:54,490
refuse to believe
your children

492
00:35:54,524 --> 00:35:56,425
even exist.

493
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,862
<i>All we ask is the chance</i>
<i>to see for ourselves.</i>

494
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:01,864
I am not a liar.

495
00:36:01,899 --> 00:36:03,933
Oh, I don't think you are.

496
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:05,668
But as I've never
met you before,

497
00:36:05,702 --> 00:36:08,905
my opinion on the matter
is of limited value.

498
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:12,876
Where I come from,

499
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,378
guests are treated
with respect,

500
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:18,715
not insulted
at the gates.

501
00:36:18,749 --> 00:36:21,250
Then perhaps you should
return to where you come from.

502
00:36:21,285 --> 00:36:23,486
We wish you well.

503
00:36:26,991 --> 00:36:28,892
What are you doing?

504
00:36:28,926 --> 00:36:31,727
You promised
to receive me.

505
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:34,230
We have received you.

506
00:36:34,264 --> 00:36:36,966
Here we are,
and here you are.

507
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,904
If you do not let us in,
all of us will die.

508
00:36:40,938 --> 00:36:43,640
Which we shall
deeply regret.

509
00:36:43,674 --> 00:36:44,745
But Qarth did not become

510
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,890
the greatest city that
ever was or will be

511
00:36:46,911 --> 00:36:50,581
by letting Dothraki savages
through its gates.

512
00:36:57,455 --> 00:36:59,690
Khaleesi, please
be careful.

513
00:37:02,527 --> 00:37:05,129
Thirteen!

514
00:37:05,163 --> 00:37:07,665
When my dragons are grown,

515
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:10,801
we will take back
what was stolen from me

516
00:37:10,836 --> 00:37:13,170
and destroy those
who have wronged me.

517
00:37:13,205 --> 00:37:15,673
We will lay waste
to armies

518
00:37:15,707 --> 00:37:18,408
and burn cities
to the ground.

519
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:22,412
Turn us away and we will
burn you first.

520
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:24,614
Ah.

521
00:37:24,649 --> 00:37:27,417
You are a true
Targaryen.

522
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:30,587
Only, as you said
a moment ago,

523
00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:32,222
if we don't let you
into the city,

524
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:34,758
you will all die.
And so...

525
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:37,427
Retreating in fear
from a little girl

526
00:37:37,461 --> 00:37:39,629
is unbecoming
of the greatest city

527
00:37:39,663 --> 00:37:41,231
that ever was
or will be.

528
00:37:41,265 --> 00:37:44,802
The discussion is over,
Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

529
00:37:44,836 --> 00:37:46,837
The Thirteen have spoken.

530
00:37:46,872 --> 00:37:49,607
I am one of the Thirteen

531
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:52,076
and I am still speaking.

532
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,445
The girl threatens to burn
our city to the ground

533
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:57,648
and you would invite her in
for a cup of wine?

534
00:37:57,682 --> 00:37:59,750
She is the Mother
of Dragons.

535
00:37:59,784 --> 00:38:03,086
Do you expect her to watch
her people starve

536
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,221
without breathing fire?

537
00:38:05,256 --> 00:38:07,824
<i>I believe we can allow</i>
<i>a few Dothraki</i>

538
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:10,426
<i>through our gates</i>
<i>without dooming our city.</i>

539
00:38:10,461 --> 00:38:13,764
<i>After all, here I am,</i>

540
00:38:13,798 --> 00:38:15,866
a savage from
the Summer Isles,

541
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,769
and Qarth still stands.

542
00:38:17,836 --> 00:38:20,705
Our decision is final.

543
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,875
Very well.

544
00:38:25,145 --> 00:38:27,747
I invoke <i>Soumai.</i>

545
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:34,252
<i>I will vouch for her,</i>
<i>her people,</i>

546
00:38:34,287 --> 00:38:37,655
<i>and her dragons</i>
<i>in accordance with the law.</i>

547
00:38:43,662 --> 00:38:45,662
Be it on your head.

548
00:38:47,064 --> 00:38:50,032
Welcome to Qarth,
My Lady.

549
00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:41,951
<i>You.</i>

550
00:39:50,395 --> 00:39:52,829
Is there gold or silver
in the village?

551
00:39:52,863 --> 00:39:55,765
- I'm not from the village.
- Where is the Brotherhood?

552
00:39:56,734 --> 00:39:58,401
I don't know
what that is.

553
00:40:27,499 --> 00:40:31,969
<i>You two, take Lord Lannister's</i>
<i>things to his quarters.</i>

554
00:40:32,004 --> 00:40:33,604
What's this?

555
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,307
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

556
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:38,977
Evidently not.

557
00:40:41,013 --> 00:40:42,814
Why are these prisoners
not in their cells?

558
00:40:42,848 --> 00:40:45,217
<i>Cells are overflowing,</i>
<i>My Lord.</i>

559
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:46,852
<i>This lot won't be here long.</i>

560
00:40:46,886 --> 00:40:49,288
<i>Don't need</i>
<i>no permanent place.</i>

561
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,325
After we interrogate 'em,
we usually just...

562
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:56,696
Are we so well-manned
that we can afford to discard

563
00:40:56,731 --> 00:40:59,533
able young bodies
and skilled laborers?

564
00:41:09,078 --> 00:41:11,747
You,
do you have a trade?

565
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:14,583
<i>Smith, My Lord.</i>

566
00:41:16,086 --> 00:41:18,454
What are you looking at?
Kneel!

567
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:23,292
Kneel or I'll carve
your lungs out, boy.

568
00:41:23,326 --> 00:41:25,627
He'll do no such thing.

569
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:29,364
This one's a girl,
you idiot,

570
00:41:29,398 --> 00:41:30,765
dressed as a boy.

571
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:33,868
- Why?
- Safer to travel, My Lord.

572
00:41:33,902 --> 00:41:36,003
Smart.

573
00:41:36,037 --> 00:41:37,905
More than I can say
for this lot.

574
00:41:37,939 --> 00:41:40,608
Get these prisoners
to work.

575
00:41:40,642 --> 00:41:42,576
Bring the girl.

576
00:41:42,611 --> 00:41:44,678
I need a new
cupbearer.

577
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:46,314
<i>My Lord.</i>

578
00:41:53,723 --> 00:41:55,724
Your visits
are too few, cousin.

579
00:41:55,759 --> 00:41:57,359
Her Grace,
the Queen Regent,

580
00:41:57,393 --> 00:41:59,762
commands you to release
Grand Maester Pycelle.

581
00:41:59,796 --> 00:42:03,132
- Here's your warrant.
- So it is.

582
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:05,535
Will you take
a cup with me?

583
00:42:05,569 --> 00:42:08,038
I find that mulled wine
helps me sleep.

584
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:10,073
<i>I am here</i>
<i>at her Grace's behest,</i>

585
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:12,275
not to drink
with you, Imp.

586
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:15,178
If my sister was
so concerned for Pycelle,

587
00:42:15,212 --> 00:42:17,413
<i>I would have thought</i>
<i>she'd come herself.</i>

588
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:19,481
Instead she sends you.

589
00:42:19,516 --> 00:42:20,949
What am I to make
of that?

590
00:42:20,984 --> 00:42:23,018
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>what you make of it,</i>

591
00:42:23,052 --> 00:42:25,086
so long as you release
your prisoner immediately.

592
00:42:25,121 --> 00:42:29,224
And you've received these
instructions directly from Cersei?

593
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:31,526
As I said several times.

594
00:42:31,561 --> 00:42:34,463
And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?

595
00:42:34,497 --> 00:42:36,697
When the Queen Regent
gives me a command, I carry

596
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:38,722
it out without delay.

597
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:43,773
Cersei must have
great trust in you,

598
00:42:43,807 --> 00:42:46,009
<i>allowing you</i>
<i>into her chamber</i>

599
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:48,912
during the hour
of the wolf.

600
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:55,719
The Queen Regent has a great
many responsibilities.

601
00:42:55,753 --> 00:42:57,354
She often works
from dusk till dawn.

602
00:42:57,388 --> 00:42:59,722
She must be very glad
to have you helping her

603
00:42:59,757 --> 00:43:02,091
from dusk till dawn.

604
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:05,126
Ah, lavender oil.

605
00:43:05,161 --> 00:43:07,696
She always loved lavender oil,
even as a girl.

606
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,364
I am a Knight!

607
00:43:10,232 --> 00:43:12,167
An anointed Knight, yes.

608
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:14,770
Tell me, did Cersei
have you knighted

609
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:18,374
before or after she took
you into her bed?

610
00:43:18,408 --> 00:43:21,044
What?
Nothing to say?

611
00:43:21,078 --> 00:43:22,979
No more warnings
for me, Ser?

612
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:24,948
You will withdraw
these filthy accusations.

613
00:43:24,983 --> 00:43:26,550
Have you ever given
any thought

614
00:43:26,584 --> 00:43:28,485
to what King Joffrey
will have to say

615
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,922
when he finds out you've
been bedding his mother?

616
00:43:35,493 --> 00:43:37,394
It's not my fault!

617
00:43:37,428 --> 00:43:40,096
Did she take you
against your will?

618
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,131
Can you not defend
yourself, Knight?

619
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:45,401
Your own father, Lord Tywin,
when I was named the King's squire,

620
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:47,370
he told me to obey her
in everything.

621
00:43:47,404 --> 00:43:49,271
Did he tell you
to fuck her, too?

622
00:43:49,305 --> 00:43:52,541
I only meant
I did as I was bid.

623
00:43:52,575 --> 00:43:54,343
Hated every
moment of it,

624
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:56,378
is that what you'll
have me believe?

625
00:43:56,413 --> 00:43:58,448
A high place in court,
a knighthood,

626
00:43:58,482 --> 00:44:00,717
my sister's legs spreading
open for you at night.

627
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:03,086
Oh, yes, it must
have been terrible.

628
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,122
Wait here. His Grace will want
to hear this.

629
00:44:05,156 --> 00:44:07,425
Mercy!
Mercy, My Lord! I beg you.

630
00:44:07,459 --> 00:44:09,060
Save it for Joffrey.
He loves a good grovel.

631
00:44:09,094 --> 00:44:10,815
My Lord, it was
your sister's bidding--

632
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,930
the Queen.

633
00:44:11,931 --> 00:44:13,798
I'll leave the city
at once, I swear.

634
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:17,035
- No, I think not.
- My Lord?

635
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:19,036
You heard me.

636
00:44:22,507 --> 00:44:24,115
My father told you
to obey my sister.

637
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,576
Obey her.

638
00:44:25,577 --> 00:44:28,946
Stay close to her side.
Keep her trust.

639
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,048
Pleasure her
whenever she requires.

640
00:44:31,082 --> 00:44:33,150
No one ever need know

641
00:44:33,184 --> 00:44:36,620
as long as you keep
faith with me.

642
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:40,122
I want to know
what Cersei is doing,

643
00:44:40,157 --> 00:44:43,025
where she goes,
who she sees,

644
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:45,460
what they talk of--
everything.

645
00:44:45,495 --> 00:44:47,495
And you will tell me.

646
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:49,898
Yes, My Lord, I will.

647
00:44:49,932 --> 00:44:52,233
I swear it,
as you command.

648
00:44:55,504 --> 00:44:57,805
Oh, rise, rise.

649
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,009
Let us drink to
our understanding.

650
00:45:01,043 --> 00:45:03,578
Oh, you don't have
a cup. Oh, well.

651
00:45:03,613 --> 00:45:06,682
Smile, cousin. My sister
is a beautiful woman.

652
00:45:06,716 --> 00:45:08,350
And it's all for
the good of the realm.

653
00:45:08,384 --> 00:45:10,986
Go back and tell her
that I beg her forgiveness,

654
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,088
that I want no more
conflict between us

655
00:45:13,122 --> 00:45:14,866
and that henceforth

656
00:45:14,891 --> 00:45:16,859
I shall do nothing
without her consent.

657
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,160
But her demands.

658
00:45:18,194 --> 00:45:20,829
Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

659
00:45:20,864 --> 00:45:23,098
- You will?
- Yes, I'll release him in the morning.

660
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:25,067
<i>Cersei can keep him</i>
<i>as a pet if she wants,</i>

661
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:27,102
<i>but I will not have him</i>
<i>on the council.</i>

662
00:45:27,137 --> 00:45:29,972
I could swear that I had not
harmed a single hair on his head,

663
00:45:30,006 --> 00:45:33,509
but that would not,
strictly speaking, be true.

664
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:47,789
<i>Stay within</i>
<i>one table length.</i>

665
00:45:52,462 --> 00:45:54,763
Your Grace.

666
00:45:59,302 --> 00:46:01,636
Do your knucklebones
bring you luck?

667
00:46:04,506 --> 00:46:07,541
Well, life's been good since you
hacked them off, Your Grace.

668
00:46:07,576 --> 00:46:09,977
And it's four less
fingernails to clean.

669
00:46:10,012 --> 00:46:12,546
- Fewer.
- Pardon?

670
00:46:13,548 --> 00:46:15,516
Four fewer
fingernails to clean.

671
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:18,886
Never understood
why you had to wear them.

672
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,889
It reminds me of where I
come from and where I am now.

673
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:24,960
It reminds me
of your justice.

674
00:46:24,994 --> 00:46:26,495
It was an honest
punishment

675
00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:28,064
and you were good
with the cleaver.

676
00:46:28,098 --> 00:46:30,766
You were a hero
and a smuggler.

677
00:46:30,801 --> 00:46:34,236
A good act does not
wash out the bad,

678
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:37,138
nor a bad the good.

679
00:46:37,173 --> 00:46:39,641
A lesson I've tried
to teach my son.

680
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:41,776
- Does he listen?
- To me?

681
00:46:41,811 --> 00:46:44,479
Gods, no.

682
00:46:44,513 --> 00:46:47,281
But if your red woman told him
to leap from the crow's nest--

683
00:46:47,316 --> 00:46:49,617
She has a name.

684
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,022
I trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

685
00:46:57,326 --> 00:46:59,361
I've lived within
the law for 17--

686
00:46:59,395 --> 00:47:01,796
I want you to be
a smuggler this time.

687
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:04,399
Any shore, any night.

688
00:47:04,434 --> 00:47:06,168
What am I bringing
ashore?

689
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:08,037
The red woman.

690
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,908
No one must know
what you do

691
00:47:11,942 --> 00:47:13,543
and we'll not speak
of this again.

692
00:47:13,578 --> 00:47:17,113
I am true to Your Grace
and always will be,

693
00:47:17,148 --> 00:47:20,116
but surely there are
other ways, cleaner ways.

694
00:47:20,151 --> 00:47:22,585
Cleaner ways
don't win wars.

695
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,287
Are you afraid,
onion knight?

696
00:47:57,524 --> 00:47:58,773
Someone once told me

697
00:47:58,798 --> 00:48:01,196
the night is dark and
full of terrors.

698
00:48:02,895 --> 00:48:05,597
You've carried more
unpleasant cargo in your time.

699
00:48:09,501 --> 00:48:12,437
Are you a good man,
Ser Davos Seaworth?

700
00:48:12,471 --> 00:48:14,431
I'd say my parts
are mixed, My Lady--

701
00:48:15,256 --> 00:48:16,341
good and bad.

702
00:48:16,342 --> 00:48:18,844
If half an onion
is black with rot,

703
00:48:18,878 --> 00:48:20,779
it's a rotten onion.

704
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:23,516
A man is good
or he is evil.

705
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,417
- And which are you?
- <i>Oh, good.</i>

706
00:48:25,452 --> 00:48:28,754
I'm a Knight myself
of sorts,

707
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:31,624
a champion of light
and life.

708
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:34,827
Well, that must be
very nice for you.

709
00:48:51,081 --> 00:48:55,217
- Do you love your wife?
- I do.

710
00:48:55,252 --> 00:48:57,553
Yet you have known
other women.

711
00:48:57,587 --> 00:48:59,421
Don't talk about my wife.

712
00:48:59,455 --> 00:49:03,425
I'm not. I'm talking about
other women.

713
00:49:03,459 --> 00:49:05,827
Like me, Ser Davos.

714
00:49:10,099 --> 00:49:12,000
You want me.

715
00:49:12,035 --> 00:49:15,003
You want to see
what's beneath this robe.

716
00:49:16,606 --> 00:49:18,807
And you will.

717
00:49:23,347 --> 00:49:26,383
Strange that
this Lord of Light

718
00:49:26,417 --> 00:49:29,286
asks you to work
in the shadows.

719
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,589
Shadows cannot live
in the dark, Ser Davos.

720
00:49:32,624 --> 00:49:35,125
They are servants
of light,

721
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:37,594
the children of fire.

722
00:49:37,628 --> 00:49:41,064
And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.

723
00:49:41,098 --> 00:49:43,933
These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.

724
00:49:45,436 --> 00:49:47,703
They can't bar
our passage.

725
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,644
Gods protect us.

726
00:49:54,678 --> 00:49:58,181
There's only one God,
Ser Davos,

727
00:49:58,215 --> 00:50:00,917
and he only protects
those who serve him.
