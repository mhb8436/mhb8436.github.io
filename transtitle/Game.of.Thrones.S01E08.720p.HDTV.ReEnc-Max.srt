2
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,409
Left high, left low.

3
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:17,345
Right low,

4
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,570
lunge right.

5
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,436
You break anything,
the Septa will have my head.

6
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:40,368
Your sister knew perfectly well
we were to leave today.

7
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,592
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.

8
00:02:42,717 --> 00:02:45,177
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.

9
00:02:45,302 --> 00:02:47,960
She always comes back with
scrapes and bruises. She's so clumsy.

10
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:52,086
Go back to your room.

11
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:54,255
Bar the doors

12
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,387
and do not open them for anyone
you do not know.

13
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:59,580
- What is it? What's happening?
- Do as I told you.

14
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:00,706
Run!

15
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:20,950
Left, right.

16
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,094
Now you are dead.

17
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:25,862
You said right,

18
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,251
- but you went left.
- And now you are a dead girl.

19
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,503
Only 'cause you lied.

20
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:35,222
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.

21
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,431
- You were not seeing.
- I was so.

22
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,305
- I watched, but you...
- Watching is not seeing, dead girl.

23
00:03:45,508 --> 00:03:46,558
The seeing,

24
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:48,528
the true seeing,

25
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:51,361
that is the heart of swordplay.

26
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,112
Arya Stark,

27
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,906
Come with us.
Your father wants to see you.

28
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,055
And why is it that Lord Eddard

29
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,498
is sending Lannister men
in place of his own? I am wondering.

30
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,668
Mind your place, dancing master.

31
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,881
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.

32
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,262
And I don't have to go
with you if I don't want.

33
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:27,017
- Take her.
- Are you men or snakes,

34
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,643
that you would threaten a child?

35
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:30,854
Get out of my way, little man.

36
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:34,274
I am Syrio Forel...

37
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,525
Foreign bastard.

38
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:42,824
And you will be speaking to me
with more respect.

39
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,327
Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.

40
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:50,194
Arya child, we are done
with dancing for the day.

41
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,208
Run to your father.

42
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:14,375
Bloody oafs.

43
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:17,525
Be gone now, Arya.

44
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,909
Come with me.

45
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:20,750
Run.

46
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:24,574
The first sword of Braavos
does not run.

47
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:39,589
What do we say to the God of death?

48
00:05:41,604 --> 00:05:42,509
Not today.

49
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,470
Go.

50
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:13,665
Not today. Not today.

51
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,386
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.

52
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,347
I'll tell the Queen.

53
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:32,934
Who do you think sent me?

54
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,198
Needle.

55
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:51,828
There she is.

56
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:55,122
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.

57
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:56,791
- Come here.
- Leave me be.

58
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,503
- My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me... the Queen!

59
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:02,505
Stay away!

60
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,036
Lord Stark,

61
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:35,246
you must be thirsty.

62
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:43,136
I promise you it isn't poisoned.

63
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:46,925
Why is it no one
ever trusts the eunuch?

64
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:59,146
Not so much, My Lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.

65
00:07:59,907 --> 00:08:03,507
Hide it. Men have been known to die
of thirst in these cells.

66
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:07,095
What about my daughters?

67
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:10,272
The younger one seems
to have escaped the castle.

68
00:08:10,397 --> 00:08:12,679
Even my little birds cannot find her.

69
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:15,973
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.

70
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:19,853
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though...

71
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,087
All dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.

72
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:28,824
You watched my men being slaughtered
and did nothing.

73
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:30,699
And would again, My Lord.

74
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:35,390
I was unarmed, unarmored
and surrounded by Lannister swords.

75
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,559
When you look at me
do you see a hero?

76
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:46,179
What madness led you
to tell the Queen

77
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:49,106
you had learned the truth
about Joffrey's birth?

78
00:08:51,178 --> 00:08:52,728
The madness of mercy.

79
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:59,581
- That she might save her children.
- The children.

80
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,197
It is always the innocents
who suffer.

81
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:05,420
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert,
nor the boar.

82
00:09:06,257 --> 00:09:09,001
The wine slowed him down
and the boar ripped him open,

83
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:12,010
but it was your mercy
that killed the King.

84
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:19,187
I trust you know you are
a dead man, Lord Eddard?

85
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,732
The Queen can't kill me.

86
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:28,242
Cat holds her brother.

87
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:31,114
The wrong brother sadly.

88
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,524
And lost to her.

89
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:36,242
Your wife has let the Imp
slip through her fingers.

90
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:41,673
If that's true,

91
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:46,337
then slit my throat
and be done with it.

92
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,540
Not today, My Lord.

93
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,598
Tell me something, Varys.

94
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,287
Who do you truly serve?

95
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:01,255
The Realm, My Lord.

96
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:02,952
Someone must.

97
00:10:22,632 --> 00:10:23,539
It's Othor,

98
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,431
without a doubt.

99
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,169
The other one is Jafer Flowers,

100
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,859
less the hand the wolf tore off.

101
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,674
Any sign of Benjen

102
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,590
or the rest of his party?

103
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:36,651
Just these two, My Lord.

104
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:38,882
Been dead awhile, I'd say.

105
00:10:40,696 --> 00:10:41,516
The smell.

106
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:46,361
What smell?

107
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:49,204
There is none.

108
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:52,235
If they'd be dead for a long time,
wouldn't there be rot?

109
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,927
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, My Lord.

110
00:10:58,052 --> 00:10:59,414
Fire will do for them.

111
00:10:59,787 --> 00:11:00,785
The Wildling way.

112
00:11:01,742 --> 00:11:04,386
I want Maester Aemon
to examine them first.

113
00:11:05,544 --> 00:11:08,542
You may be a coward, Tarly,
but you're not stupid.

114
00:11:10,245 --> 00:11:11,296
Get them inside.

115
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:13,548
You heard him.

116
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,434
Lord Commander,

117
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:19,721
Maester Aemon awaits you
in his chambers...

118
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,599
a raven from King's Landing.

119
00:11:24,311 --> 00:11:25,776
Come on, move 'em out.

120
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,755
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow,

121
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,415
and pour one for yourself.

122
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,798
The King is dead.

123
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,641
Is there any word of my father?

124
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:11,150
Sit.

125
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:18,691
Lord Stark has been

126
00:12:19,646 --> 00:12:21,157
charged with treason.

127
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:24,593
They say he conspired
with Robert's brothers

128
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:27,080
to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.

129
00:12:39,803 --> 00:12:42,501
I hope you're not thinking
of doing anything stupid.

130
00:12:43,652 --> 00:12:46,682
Your duty lies here now.

131
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,644
My sisters were
in King's Landing too.

132
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:53,846
I'm sure they'll be

133
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:55,942
treated gently.

134
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,365
Your father has proved
to be an awful traitor, dear.

135
00:13:03,293 --> 00:13:06,116
King Robert's body was still warm

136
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:10,164
when Lord Eddard began plotting
to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

137
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,770
He wouldn't do that.

138
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:15,503
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.

139
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:18,631
Please, Your Grace,
there's been a mistake.

140
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,301
Send for my father. He'll tell you...
The King was his friend.

141
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:25,796
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of
any wrong. We know that.

142
00:13:26,478 --> 00:13:28,431
Yet you are the daughter
of a traitor.

143
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:31,227
How can I allow you to marry my son?

144
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:34,313
A child born of a traitor's seed

145
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:36,774
is no fit consort for our King.

146
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:39,318
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace,

147
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,435
but in 10 years,
who knows what treasons she may hatch?

148
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:46,993
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.

149
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,287
I'll be a Queen just like you,
I promise.

150
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,414
I won't hatch anything.

151
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:55,126
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.

152
00:13:56,146 --> 00:13:58,883
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

153
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:06,845
Little dove,

154
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,793
you must write to Lady Catelyn

155
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,552
and your brother,
the eldest, what's his name?

156
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:12,759
Robb.

157
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:15,676
Word of your father's arrest
will reach him soon, no doubt.

158
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,958
Best it comes from you.

159
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,861
If you would help your father, urge
your brother to keep the King's peace.

160
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,657
Tell him to come to King's Landing
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

161
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,458
If I could see my father,
talk to him about...

162
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,421
You disappoint me, child.

163
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:44,676
We have told you
of your father's treason.

164
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,882
Why would you want
to speak to a traitor?

165
00:14:47,894 --> 00:14:49,269
I only meant that...

166
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:53,142
What will happen to him?

167
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:56,020
That depends.

168
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,396
On...

169
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,099
- On what?
- On your brother.

170
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:04,961
And on you.

171
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:15,339
Treason?

172
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:18,668
Sansa wrote this?

173
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,128
It is your sister's hand,
but the Queen's words.

174
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:24,972
You are summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new King.

175
00:15:25,638 --> 00:15:28,344
Joffrey puts my father in chains,
now he wants his ass kissed?

176
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:31,985
This is a royal command, My Lord.

177
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:34,642
- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.

178
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:39,581
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.

179
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:43,276
But not alone.

180
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,113
Call the banners.

181
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:50,741
All of them, My Lord?

182
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,702
They've all sworn
to defend my father?

183
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:54,337
They have.

184
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:56,789
Now we see
what their words are worth.

185
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,719
Are you afraid?

186
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:14,964
I must be.

187
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,850
Good.

188
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,687
Why is that good?

189
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:21,814
It means you're not stupid.

190
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,131
You've had this since dawn?

191
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,812
He sent it to me, not you.

192
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:53,763
- I've shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?!

193
00:16:55,202 --> 00:16:57,283
My husband has been taken prisoner.

194
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:58,934
My son intends to declare war.

195
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:00,469
A war?

196
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,147
Your son against the Lannisters?

197
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:05,858
You should go to him.

198
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,904
Teach him patience.

199
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,863
Ned rots in a dungeon
and you speak of patience?

200
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:13,385
He is your brother by law!

201
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:15,493
Does family mean nothing to you?

202
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,095
Family means everything to me.

203
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:21,595
And I will not risk Robin's life

204
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,268
to get caught up
in another of your husband's wars.

205
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:25,503
I'm hungry.

206
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:27,558
Hush now, darling.

207
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,171
You just ate.

208
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:32,468
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?

209
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:36,180
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.

210
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,309
You're always welcome here, sister.

211
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:43,688
But if you're asking me to send men
from the Vale to fight...

212
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,268
That is what I ask.

213
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:49,316
Go on, sweet.

214
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:51,294
Time for your bath.

215
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:53,698
I'll feed you after.

216
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,122
If you fear for the safety
of your son...

217
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,903
Of course I fear
for the safety of my son!

218
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:05,837
Are you an idiot?

219
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:08,129
They killed my husband.

220
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,257
You say they shoved
your boy from a window.

221
00:18:11,687 --> 00:18:13,801
These people will do anything.

222
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,761
And that is why we have to stop them.

223
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:22,476
The knights of the Vale
will stay in the Vale

224
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,227
where they belong,

225
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:26,448
to protect their Lord.

226
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:41,120
Will you shut up?

227
00:18:45,006 --> 00:18:47,087
There's hill tribes all around here.

228
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:51,752
If I'm going to die, it mays as well be
with a song in my heart.

229
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:55,568
I should just take your food
and leave you here.

230
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:58,942
What would you do then?

231
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:00,695
Starve, most likely.

232
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,342
You don't think I'd do it, do you?

233
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:08,037
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold? Women?

234
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,063
Golden women?

235
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,189
Stick with me
and you'll have them all,

236
00:19:13,314 --> 00:19:16,270
for as long as I'm around
and not for a moment longer.

237
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:18,627
But you knew that.

238
00:19:19,463 --> 00:19:23,074
That is why you so valiantly
took up arms to defend my honor.

239
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:26,118
Fair enough.

240
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:29,758
But don't go looking
for me to bend the knee

241
00:19:29,883 --> 00:19:32,398
and "My Lord" you
every time you take a shit.

242
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,738
I'm not your toady
and I'm not your friend.

243
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,902
Though I would treasure
your friendship,

244
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:41,539
I'm mainly interested
in your facility with murder.

245
00:19:42,275 --> 00:19:44,976
And if the day ever comes
when you're tempted to sell me out,

246
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,346
remember this:

247
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:48,146
Whatever their price,

248
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,471
I'll beat it.

249
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,370
I like living.

250
00:20:30,866 --> 00:20:32,506
Come, share our fire.

251
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,767
Help yourselves to our goat.

252
00:20:42,962 --> 00:20:44,960
When you meet your Gods,
you tell them

253
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:47,515
Shagga Son of Dolf

254
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,776
of the Stone Crows sent you.

255
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,946
I am Tyrion son of Tywin
of Clan Lannister.

256
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:56,966
How would you like to die,
Tyrion son of Tywin?

257
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:01,371
In my own bed, at the age of 80

258
00:21:02,156 --> 00:21:05,015
with a belly full of wine and
a girl's mouth around my cock.

259
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:11,971
Take the half man.

260
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:14,817
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.

261
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,657
My House is rich and powerful.

262
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:23,115
If you see us
through these mountains,

263
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,096
my father will shower you with gold.

264
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,497
We have no use
for a half man's promises.

265
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:30,583
Half a man maybe, but at least I have
the courage to face my enemies.

266
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,670
What do the Stone Crows do?

267
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,343
Hide behind rocks

268
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:37,856
and shiver
when the knights of the Vale ride by?

269
00:21:39,524 --> 00:21:41,469
Are those the best weapons
you could steal?

270
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,723
Good enough for killing sheep,
if the sheep don't fight back.

271
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:48,685
Lannister smiths shit better steel.

272
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:57,819
You think you can win us over
with your trinkets?

273
00:22:09,105 --> 00:22:12,041
That trinket is worth more
than everything your tribe owns.

274
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,388
But if you help us,
Shagga Son of Dolf,

275
00:22:17,832 --> 00:22:19,782
I will not give you trinkets.

276
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,552
I will give you this.

277
00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:25,012
What is "this"?

278
00:22:26,516 --> 00:22:27,807
The Vale of Arryn.

279
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,061
The Lords of the Vale
have always spat upon the hill tribes.

280
00:22:33,397 --> 00:22:35,713
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.

281
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:40,153
I believe it is time
for new Lords of the Vale.

282
00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:50,997
Now there's a rare sight...

283
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,791
not only a bastard,
but a traitor's bastard.

284
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,139
Stop, put it down!

285
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:13,644
Blood will always tell.

286
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,377
You'll hang for this, bastard.

287
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:39,170
I told you not to do anything stupid.

288
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,840
You're confined to quarters.
Go.

289
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:09,534
Ghost, what's wrong?

290
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,453
Is something out there?

291
00:24:44,853 --> 00:24:45,854
Commander?

292
00:24:50,753 --> 00:24:51,754
Stay.

293
00:25:04,797 --> 00:25:05,798
Hello?

294
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:16,559
Who's there?

295
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:24,846
Lord Commander?

296
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:12,380
Move!

297
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:32,218
What did they do?

298
00:26:49,748 --> 00:26:52,345
I thought the Dothraki
didn't believe in money.

299
00:26:53,621 --> 00:26:55,241
Gold to hire ships, Princess,

300
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,776
ships to sail to Westeros.

301
00:27:15,696 --> 00:27:17,155
Jorah, make them stop.

302
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,140
You heard me.

303
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,072
These men have shed blood
for their Khal.

304
00:27:22,197 --> 00:27:23,602
Now they claim their rewards.

305
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,868
You have a gentle heart,
but this is how it's always been.

306
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,480
I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.

307
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,176
Come.

308
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:08,873
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.

309
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:10,957
And those women there.

310
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:14,945
You cannot claim them all, Princess.

311
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,236
I can,

312
00:28:17,438 --> 00:28:18,488
and I will.

313
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,843
Thank you, silver lady.

314
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,605
Who are you?

315
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:43,972
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the Godswife of this Temple.

316
00:31:45,219 --> 00:31:47,118
My mother was Godswife
here before me.

317
00:31:47,243 --> 00:31:49,743
She taught me how to make
healing smokes and ointments.

318
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,746
All men are of one flock,
so my people believe.

319
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,372
The Great Shepherd sent me
to Earth to heal his...

320
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:02,495
lamb or lion,

321
00:32:02,966 --> 00:32:05,217
his wound must be washed and sewn

322
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:06,670
or it will fester.

323
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:38,167
For 30 years

324
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,842
I've been making corpses
out of men, boy.

325
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,881
I'm the man you want
leading the Vanguard.

326
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,551
Galbart Glover will lead the Van.

327
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:50,262
The bloody Wall will melt

328
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,389
before an Umber marches
behind a Glover.

329
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,519
I will lead the Van

330
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,773
or I will take my men
and march them home.

331
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:08,530
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.

332
00:33:09,308 --> 00:33:11,617
And when I am done
with the Lannisters,

333
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,506
I'll march back North,

334
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:15,454
root you out of your Keep

335
00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:18,123
and hang you for an oathbreaker.

336
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:19,992
Oathbreaker, is it?!

337
00:33:21,815 --> 00:33:24,307
I'll not sit here and swallow insults

338
00:33:24,432 --> 00:33:26,709
from a boy so green he pisses grass.

339
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,564
My Lord father taught me

340
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:44,934
it was death to bare steel
against your Liege Lord.

341
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:49,655
But doubtless the Greatjon
only meant to cut my meat for me.

342
00:33:52,034 --> 00:33:53,300
Your meat...

343
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:01,697
is bloody tough.

344
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,094
- What is it? What's happened?
- It's all right.

345
00:34:40,507 --> 00:34:41,665
Where are you going?

346
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,833
South. For father.

347
00:34:44,244 --> 00:34:47,662
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.

348
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:50,290
I don't want them
to know we're coming.

349
00:34:51,386 --> 00:34:53,283
They have more men than we do.

350
00:34:53,408 --> 00:34:54,649
Aye, they do.

351
00:34:56,224 --> 00:34:57,389
Can't I come with you?

352
00:34:57,871 --> 00:35:00,149
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.

353
00:35:00,573 --> 00:35:02,102
And I won't get in the way, I...

354
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,434
There must always be
a Stark at Winterfell.

355
00:35:05,256 --> 00:35:06,690
Until I return that will be you.

356
00:35:09,698 --> 00:35:12,404
You are not to leave the castle walls
while we are gone. Do you understand?

357
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,485
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.

358
00:35:19,522 --> 00:35:20,523
I will.

359
00:35:21,058 --> 00:35:22,822
I'll send letters whenever I can,

360
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,883
but if you don't hear from me,

361
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:27,000
don't be scared.

362
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:33,469
Until I return.

363
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,613
How long have you been
hiding out there?

364
00:35:58,075 --> 00:35:59,868
Robb will be looking for you

365
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,216
to say goodbye.

366
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,126
They've all gone away.

367
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:06,124
They'll be back soon.

368
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,461
Robb will free Father
and they'll come back with Mother.

369
00:36:11,487 --> 00:36:12,744
No, they won't.

370
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:20,372
Please watch over Robb.

371
00:36:20,798 --> 00:36:23,594
And watch over
all the other men from Winterfell.

372
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:26,142
And Theon too, I suppose.

373
00:36:32,217 --> 00:36:33,599
You hear them, boy?

374
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:37,072
The Old Gods are answering you.

375
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:39,283
What are you doing here?

376
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:41,635
They're my Gods too.

377
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:47,708
Beyond the Wall,
they're the only Gods.

378
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:50,961
Even slaves are allowed to pray.

379
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,700
You're not a slave.

380
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:58,052
Well, your friend
did put a knife to my throat.

381
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:01,739
I'm not complaining, Little Lord,

382
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,179
just telling truths.

383
00:37:06,298 --> 00:37:08,103
What did you mean
about hearing the Gods?

384
00:37:09,942 --> 00:37:11,138
You asked them,

385
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:13,066
they're answering you.

386
00:37:16,747 --> 00:37:17,779
Open your ears.

387
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,536
It's only the wind.

388
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:29,291
Who do you think sends the wind
if not the Gods?

389
00:37:30,632 --> 00:37:32,252
They see you, boy.

390
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,253
They hear you.

391
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,891
Your brother will get no help
from them where he's going.

392
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,011
The Old Gods have no power
in the South.

393
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:45,682
The Weirwoods there were
all cut down a long time ago.

394
00:37:46,424 --> 00:37:48,477
How can they watch
when they have no eyes?

395
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:54,732
Well, there's a big man.

396
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,570
He has giants' blood
in him or I'm the Queen.

397
00:37:59,082 --> 00:38:01,031
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.

398
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:03,104
Go dress.

399
00:38:03,229 --> 00:38:04,284
Hodor.

400
00:38:07,557 --> 00:38:09,581
Are there really giants
beyond the Wall?

401
00:38:11,297 --> 00:38:14,086
Giants and worse than giants.

402
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:18,965
I tried telling your brother,
he's marching the wrong way.

403
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,427
All these swords,
they should be going North, boy.

404
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,513
North, not South!

405
00:38:27,629 --> 00:38:28,892
The cold winds are rising.

406
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:47,953
They were touched by White Walkers.

407
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:50,914
That's why they came back.

408
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:54,278
That's why their eyes turned blue.

409
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,435
Only fire will stop them.

410
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,066
How do you know that?

411
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,176
I read about it in a book...

412
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,166
a very old book
in Maester Aemon's library.

413
00:39:09,274 --> 00:39:10,934
What else did the book say?

414
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,461
The White Walkers

415
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,771
sleep beneath the ice
for thousands of years.

416
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:18,317
And when they wake up...

417
00:39:19,885 --> 00:39:22,946
And when they wake up, what?

418
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:28,410
I hope The Wall is high enough.

419
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:02,997
Summer snows, My Lady.

420
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:06,323
Robb's brought the North with him.

421
00:40:12,887 --> 00:40:16,441
The River Lords are falling back
with Jaime Lannister at their heels.

422
00:40:16,566 --> 00:40:20,082
And Lord Tywin is bringing around
a second Lannister army from the South.

423
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:22,672
Our scouts confirm it's even larger
than the Kingslayer's.

424
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,466
One army or two,

425
00:40:25,103 --> 00:40:27,802
the Kings in the North
threw back hosts

426
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:29,721
10 times as large.

427
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,605
You look well.

428
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:46,092
You're a welcome
sight in these troubled times.

429
00:40:46,217 --> 00:40:48,240
We had not thought
to meet you here, My Lady.

430
00:40:49,306 --> 00:40:51,269
I had not thought to be here.

431
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,078
I would speak with my son alone.

432
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:56,373
I know you will forgive me, My Lords.

433
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,625
You heard her! Move your asses!

434
00:40:58,915 --> 00:40:59,916
Come on, out.

435
00:41:01,514 --> 00:41:03,765
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?

436
00:41:04,425 --> 00:41:05,757
Have no fear, My Lady.

437
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,426
We'll shove our swords
up Tywin Lannister's bunghole

438
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,221
and then it's on to the Red Keep
to free Ned.

439
00:41:11,984 --> 00:41:13,682
You old devil, Rodrik.

440
00:41:14,325 --> 00:41:16,194
You're not wasting away, are you?

441
00:41:28,162 --> 00:41:30,722
I remember the day
you came into this world

442
00:41:31,146 --> 00:41:33,549
red-faced and squalling.

443
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,918
And now I find you
leading a host to war.

444
00:41:39,016 --> 00:41:41,051
- There was no one else.
- No one?

445
00:41:41,883 --> 00:41:43,920
Who were those men I saw here?

446
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:46,673
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.

447
00:41:48,184 --> 00:41:50,159
If you think you can send me back
to Winterfell...

448
00:41:50,284 --> 00:41:51,908
Would that I could.

449
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:56,847
There was...

450
00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:59,236
a letter.

451
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:03,773
From Sansa.

452
00:42:05,011 --> 00:42:07,027
From the Queen, you mean.

453
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,203
There's no mention of Arya.

454
00:42:29,361 --> 00:42:30,979
How many men do you have?

455
00:42:31,862 --> 00:42:32,993
18,000.

456
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,222
If I go to King's Landing
and bend my knee to Joffrey...

457
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,562
You would never be allowed to leave.

458
00:42:39,707 --> 00:42:42,204
Our best hope, our only hope...

459
00:42:43,241 --> 00:42:45,398
is that you can defeat
them in the field.

460
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:47,484
And if I lose?

461
00:42:47,828 --> 00:42:50,111
Do you know what happened
to the Targaryen children

462
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,577
when the Mad King fell?

463
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,550
They were butchered in their sleep.

464
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,834
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.

465
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:58,370
And the years
have not made him kinder.

466
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:02,868
If you lose,

467
00:43:04,175 --> 00:43:05,502
your father dies,

468
00:43:06,496 --> 00:43:08,171
your sisters die,

469
00:43:08,805 --> 00:43:10,215
we die.

470
00:43:13,426 --> 00:43:14,844
Well, that makes it simple then.

471
00:43:16,843 --> 00:43:18,181
I suppose it does.

472
00:43:41,533 --> 00:43:44,643
From here it might be best
if Bronn and I continue alone.

473
00:43:45,067 --> 00:43:47,462
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.

474
00:43:47,587 --> 00:43:49,212
Not best for me.

475
00:43:50,383 --> 00:43:52,536
If the half man betrays us,

476
00:43:52,661 --> 00:43:55,885
Shagga Son of Dolf
will cut off his manhood...

477
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,916
And feed it to the goats, yes.

478
00:44:01,098 --> 00:44:02,396
All right then.

479
00:44:03,831 --> 00:44:05,603
Time to meet my father.

480
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,678
Uncle.

481
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:41,982
Father.

482
00:44:44,435 --> 00:44:47,312
The rumors of your demise
were unfounded.

483
00:44:48,665 --> 00:44:50,220
Sorry to disappoint you.

484
00:44:51,763 --> 00:44:54,277
And who are
these Companions of yours?

485
00:44:57,537 --> 00:45:00,145
This is Shagga Son of Dolf,

486
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,577
Chieftain of the Stone Crows.

487
00:45:03,111 --> 00:45:06,998
Timett Son of Timett,
ruler of the Burned Men.

488
00:45:07,673 --> 00:45:09,167
This fair maid

489
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,600
is Chella daughter of Cheyk,

490
00:45:12,165 --> 00:45:14,089
leader of the Black Ears.

491
00:45:14,577 --> 00:45:16,508
And here we have Bronn son of...

492
00:45:18,756 --> 00:45:19,969
You wouldn't know him.

493
00:45:22,346 --> 00:45:24,215
May I present My Lord Father,

494
00:45:24,935 --> 00:45:27,637
Tywin son of Tytos
of House Lannister,

495
00:45:27,762 --> 00:45:30,814
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West?

496
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:34,605
Kind of you to go to war for me.

497
00:45:37,997 --> 00:45:41,366
You left us no choice.
The honor of the House was at stake.

498
00:45:43,379 --> 00:45:46,830
Your brother would never have submitted
to capture so meekly.

499
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,386
We have our differences, Jaime and I.

500
00:45:49,511 --> 00:45:51,584
He's braver. I'm better looking.

501
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,501
He's been covering himself in glory.

502
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:57,060
Jaime smashed the River Lords
at the Golden Tooth,

503
00:45:57,185 --> 00:45:58,758
and now lays siege to Riverrun,

504
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:01,064
Catelyn Stark's homeland.

505
00:46:01,189 --> 00:46:04,013
- And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.

506
00:46:04,589 --> 00:46:07,183
He will lead no armies
from his dungeon cell.

507
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,376
How did my sweet sister
persuade the King

508
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,187
to imprison his dear friend Ned?

509
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,897
Robert Baratheon is dead.

510
00:46:13,435 --> 00:46:14,983
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

511
00:46:18,498 --> 00:46:19,988
My sister rules, you mean.

512
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:22,907
Stark's son has called his banners.

513
00:46:23,561 --> 00:46:25,201
He moves south with a strong host.

514
00:46:25,729 --> 00:46:26,964
A green boy.

515
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,871
One taste of battle
and he'll run back to Winterfell

516
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,087
with his tail between his legs.

517
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:33,734
Maybe.

518
00:46:34,283 --> 00:46:36,826
Though the boy
does have a certain belligerence.

519
00:46:36,951 --> 00:46:38,004
You'd like him.

520
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,345
While we're on the subject of war,

521
00:46:44,114 --> 00:46:46,139
I made promises to my friends here

522
00:46:46,546 --> 00:46:48,641
and a Lannister
always pays his debts.

523
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,603
We shall require
3,000 helms and shields,

524
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:52,845
plus swords,

525
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,732
pikes, gorgets, maces...

526
00:46:56,746 --> 00:46:59,194
if it please My Lord,
Ser Addam bids me report

527
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,738
that the Northmen
have crossed the neck.

528
00:47:03,973 --> 00:47:06,238
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.

529
00:47:06,363 --> 00:47:07,394
So be it.

530
00:47:07,774 --> 00:47:10,491
Kevan, command the
drummers beat assembly.

531
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:15,292
And send word to Jaime
that I am moving against Robb Stark.

532
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:16,764
At once, My Lord.

533
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,644
The men of the Mountain clans
are great warriors.

534
00:47:33,296 --> 00:47:34,979
Ride with me against my enemies

535
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,936
and you shall have all
my son promised you and more.

536
00:47:38,061 --> 00:47:40,318
Only if the half man fights with us.

537
00:47:40,821 --> 00:47:42,987
Until we hold the steel
he pledged us,

538
00:47:43,723 --> 00:47:45,240
the little lion's life is ours.

539
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:54,916
The scouts report
Lord Tywin moves North.

540
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,969
We need to get him on broken ground,
put his Knights at a disadvantage.

541
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:03,132
We need to get around him
and break Lannister's siege of Riverrun.

542
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,010
Do that
and the River Lords will join us.

543
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,097
To do either we need to cross the river
and the only crossing is at The Twins.

544
00:48:09,945 --> 00:48:11,599
Lord Frey controls that bridge.

545
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,226
Your father's bannerman.

546
00:48:13,752 --> 00:48:16,562
"The late Lord Frey"
my father calls him.

547
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:18,356
At the Trident, he didn't appear

548
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,056
until the battle was done.

549
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:24,362
Some men takes their oaths
more seriously than others.

550
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,205
Robb's right. We need that bridge.

551
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:35,974
So what's it going to be?

552
00:48:36,555 --> 00:48:37,917
Do we move against Jaime

553
00:48:38,613 --> 00:48:40,211
or Lord Tywin?

554
00:48:44,632 --> 00:48:45,715
Your pardon.

555
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:48,094
We've captured a Lannister scout.

556
00:48:49,944 --> 00:48:50,945
Don't worry, lad.

557
00:48:51,421 --> 00:48:53,308
He won't be leaving this tent
with his head.

558
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:56,477
Where did you find him?

559
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,646
In the brush above the encampment.

560
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,417
He looked to be counting.

561
00:49:11,362 --> 00:49:12,577
How high did you get?

562
00:49:15,157 --> 00:49:16,246
20,000. Maybe more.

563
00:49:18,514 --> 00:49:21,544
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...

564
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:24,296
My father unrstands mercy,
when there is room for it.

565
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:28,676
And he understands honor...

566
00:49:31,737 --> 00:49:32,837
and courage.

567
00:49:36,025 --> 00:49:37,477
Let him go.

568
00:49:53,149 --> 00:49:56,042
Tell Lord Tywin
winter is coming for him.

569
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:00,833
20,000 northerners marching south
to find out if he really does shit gold.

570
00:50:03,097 --> 00:50:04,247
Yes, My Lord.

571
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:06,232
Thank you.

572
00:50:16,035 --> 00:50:19,410
Are you touched, boy?
Letting him go?

573
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,388
You call me boy again.

574
00:50:23,379 --> 00:50:24,380
Go on.

575
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,715
It is also the wish of His Grace

576
00:50:53,431 --> 00:50:55,887
that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,

577
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,627
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.

578
00:51:01,138 --> 00:51:04,795
... be at once raised
to the rank of Lord...

579
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:09,820
And granted the ancient seat
of Harrenhal,

580
00:51:10,539 --> 00:51:15,617
and that his sons and grandsons
shall hold this honor after him

581
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:18,368
until the end of time.

582
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:28,044
In place of the traitor Eddard Stark,
it is the wish of his Grace

583
00:51:28,982 --> 00:51:32,716
that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock

584
00:51:33,364 --> 00:51:35,237
and Warden of the West,

585
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,045
be appointed Hand of the King.

586
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:40,389
Lastly,

587
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:44,020
in these times
of treason and turmoil,

588
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:47,271
it is the view of the Council

589
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:51,526
that the life and safety
of King Joffrey

590
00:51:52,631 --> 00:51:56,097
be of paramount importance.

591
00:51:58,285 --> 00:51:59,785
Ser Barristan Selmy.

592
00:52:07,346 --> 00:52:10,030
Your Grace, I am yours to command.

593
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,262
Rise, Ser Barristan.

594
00:52:13,707 --> 00:52:15,330
You may remove your helm.

595
00:52:20,932 --> 00:52:23,494
You have served the Realm
long and faithfully.

596
00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:26,874
Every man and woman
in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.

597
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,773
But it is time to put aside
your armor and your sword.

598
00:52:31,009 --> 00:52:33,611
It is time to rest
and look back with pride

599
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,321
on your many years of service.

600
00:52:38,157 --> 00:52:39,992
The Kingsguard
is a sworn brotherhood.

601
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,160
Our vows are taken for life.

602
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,664
Only death relieves us
of our sacred trust.

603
00:52:45,071 --> 00:52:48,459
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?

604
00:52:49,588 --> 00:52:51,295
You let my father die.

605
00:52:51,716 --> 00:52:54,131
You're too old to protect anybody.

606
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,345
The Council has determined

607
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:01,847
that Ser Jaime Lannister
will take your place

608
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,117
as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

609
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:07,846
He who profaned his blade with the blood
of the King he had sworn to defend!

610
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,144
Careful, Ser.

611
00:53:10,042 --> 00:53:13,645
We have nothing but gratitude
for your long service, good Ser.

612
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,629
You shall be given
a stout keep beside the sea,

613
00:53:17,043 --> 00:53:18,948
with servants
to look after your every need.

614
00:53:19,685 --> 00:53:21,200
A hole to die in

615
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:23,494
and men to bury me.

616
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:26,955
I am a Knight.

617
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,658
I shall die a Knight.

618
00:53:37,424 --> 00:53:39,385
A naked Knight, apparently.

619
00:53:50,729 --> 00:53:54,357
Even now I could cut through
the five of you like carving a cake!

620
00:53:58,474 --> 00:53:59,654
Here, boy!

621
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,300
Melt it down and add it
to the others.

622
00:54:20,076 --> 00:54:22,053
If any man in this hall
has other matters

623
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,429
to set before His Grace,
let him speak now

624
00:54:26,015 --> 00:54:28,275
or go forth and hold his silence.

625
00:54:31,684 --> 00:54:33,272
Your Grace.

626
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,491
Come forward, My Lady.

627
00:54:37,643 --> 00:54:39,643
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.

628
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:45,076
Do you have some business
for the King and the Council?

629
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:46,792
I do.

630
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,995
As it please Your Grace,
I ask mercy for my father,

631
00:54:55,779 --> 00:54:58,366
Lord Eddard Stark,
who was Hand of the King.

632
00:54:58,491 --> 00:55:01,384
Treason is a noxious weed.

633
00:55:02,157 --> 00:55:05,596
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.

634
00:55:06,276 --> 00:55:08,307
I want to hear what she says.

635
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,767
Do you deny your father's crime?

636
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,742
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.

637
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:19,735
All I ask is mercy.

638
00:55:20,285 --> 00:55:22,571
I know my lord father
must regret what he did.

639
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:26,408
He was King Robert's friend
and he loved him, you all know it.

640
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:30,801
He never wanted to be Hand
until the King asked him.

641
00:55:31,404 --> 00:55:34,708
They must have lied to him...
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis,

642
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,460
they must have lied!

643
00:55:37,628 --> 00:55:39,308
He said I wasn't the King.

644
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:41,632
Why did he say that?

645
00:55:42,202 --> 00:55:43,602
He was badly hurt.

646
00:55:43,948 --> 00:55:45,885
Maester Pycelle was giving
him milk of the poppy.

647
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:50,891
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.

648
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:57,356
A child's faith...
such sweet innocence.

649
00:55:58,145 --> 00:56:02,235
And yet they say wisdom oft comes
from the mouths of babes.

650
00:56:02,869 --> 00:56:03,870
Treason...

651
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,824
is treason!

652
00:56:10,803 --> 00:56:12,163
Anything else?

653
00:56:13,919 --> 00:56:17,313
If you still have any affection
in your heart for me,

654
00:56:17,873 --> 00:56:20,834
please do me this kindness,
Your Grace.

655
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:32,516
Your sweet words have moved me.

656
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,094
But your father has to confess.

657
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:41,392
He has to confess
and say that I'm the King...

658
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,155
or there'll be no mercy for him.

659
00:56:51,051 --> 00:56:52,052
He will.

660
00:56:57,168 --> 00:56:59,449
